# JS Test Driven Task List

## Instructions:

For this project, you'll be building out a Task Lister application. We'll be using good OO design patterns to build out our Client Side app. To start, there will be no persitence.  However, you will need two models, one for List(s) and Task(s).  These models will need autoincrementing IDs as well as some "class" methods.  You will then need write a function to add new lists and add new tasks into the DOM. To begin, you can include this login in `app.js`.  
 
## Step 1: Setup

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. cd into the local repos folder.
4. Open SpecRunner.html in your browser to see the tests.
5. Open index.html in your browser to see the functionality. Don't forget to have dev tools debugger / console open as well to see errors.

## Step 2: Models 

Next, implement the models for Task and List. A List should have many tasks associated with it. Follow the specs to get everything passing. 

## Step 3: 

For comparison here is a live example of the finished app [linked here](http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/fe-js-oo-task-list/).
